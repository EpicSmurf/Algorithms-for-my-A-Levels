# Algorithms-for-my-A-Levels
This will have the code for the Algorithms that are needed to be learnt for OCR A-Level Year one Computer Science or AS-Level Computer Science.
There are two searching algorithmns: Linear search and Binary search.
There are 2 sorting algorithmns: Bubblesort and Insertionsort.
There are also basic data structures: Stack and Queue, which are important for understanding how data can be stored and accessed.  
Remember that this is only for Year one/AS Level Computer Science.
